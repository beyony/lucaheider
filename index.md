## I am on a trip around the world.

You currently find me in Nepal stomping through the steep slopes of the Himalayas and inhaling the dust of the capital.

I like the principle of giving and taking and authentic travelling far away from mass tourism and private hotel complexes.

I want to experience local life and culture up as close as possible and I am grateful for every opportunity! In return I want to give something back that helps the country and the people. 
 
I see a lot of possibilities for this, but above all my expertise lies in the following areas:

Photography, design, web development, music production, film production...

You need something with media? I can do that for you!

Besides that, I am always open for new things and look forward to all possibilities.
